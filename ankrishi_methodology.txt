# ANKRISHI METHODOLOGY

## RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

### 1. User-Centered Design Process

Ankrishi's development follows a rigorous user-centered design methodology that places farmers at the core of all decision-making:

1. **Immersive Field Research**: Our team spent 3 months across 12 villages in Maharashtra conducting:
   - In-depth interviews with 200+ farmers across different land holding sizes
   - Shadowing of 50 farmers through their entire selling process
   - Documentation of pain points in the current agricultural value chain
   - Observation of existing technology usage patterns among rural communities

2. **Participatory Design Workshops**: Conducted 15 collaborative design sessions with:
   - Small and marginal farmers (less than 2 hectares)
   - Medium-scale farmers (2-10 hectares)
   - Agricultural vendors and buyers
   - Local agricultural extension workers
   - Rural technology adoption specialists

3. **Iterative Prototyping**: Developed and refined the platform through:
   - Paper prototypes tested with 100+ potential users
   - Low-fidelity digital mockups evaluated for usability
   - Functional prototypes deployed in controlled environments
   - Continuous feedback incorporation from all stakeholder groups

4. **Accessibility Optimization**: Ensured the platform works for users with:
   - Limited digital literacy through intuitive interface design
   - Varying levels of connectivity through offline functionality
   - Different language preferences through multilingual support (Hindi, Marathi, English)
   - Visual impairments through voice-enabled features

   - Further evolution to PostgreSQL and custom backend at 25,000 users

2. **Accessibility**: Ensuring technology works in rural Indian context
   - React Native enables cross-platform deployment on diverse Android devices
   - Optimized for low-bandwidth environments with data-efficient operations
   - Designed for intermittent connectivity with offline-first functionality

3. **Security**: Protecting sensitive user and transaction data
   - End-to-end encryption for all financial transactions
   - Secure authentication with phone number verification
   - Role-based access control for different user types
   - Regular security audits and vulnerability testing

4. **Maintainability**: Supporting long-term development and updates
   - TypeScript for type safety and code quality
   - Modular architecture for feature-by-feature deployment
   - Comprehensive documentation for knowledge transfer
   - Automated testing for regression prevention
