   - Clear mitigation strategies exist for technical challenges
   - Defined pathway for scaling from prototype to production system

2. Economic Feasibility: Medium to High
   - Initial development costs are reasonable
   - Multiple revenue streams provide diversification
   - Break-even timeline of 24-30 months is realistic for this sector
   - Potential for significant impact and growth after achieving scale

For a hackathon implementation, the focus should be on demonstrating core functionality with a clear vision for how the platform would scale technically and economically in a real-world deployment. The modular architecture allows for prioritizing features that showcase the concept while acknowledging which aspects would require further development post-hackathon.
