# ANKRISHI CONCEPT STATEMENT

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Ankrishi is a comprehensive agricultural platform designed to transform India's fragmented agricultural ecosystem by directly connecting farmers with buyers, providing critical information access, and offering financial management tools. The platform addresses the fundamental challenges of intermediary exploitation, information asymmetry, and financial vulnerability that currently plague Indian agriculture. Through a village-by-village scaling approach, Ankrishi aims to increase farmer incomes by 40-60% while creating a more efficient and equitable agricultural marketplace.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Indian agriculture faces several interconnected challenges that significantly impact farmer livelihoods:

1. Fragmented Supply Chain: 5-6 intermediaries between farmers and consumers capture 60-70% of the final price, leaving farmers with minimal profits. For example, farmers receive only ₹10/kg for tomatoes that consumers purchase at ₹40/kg.

2. Limited Market Access: Small farmers are restricted to local mandis where price manipulation is common, with limited transportation options to reach larger markets.

3. Information Asymmetry: Farmers lack access to weather forecasts, market prices, and agricultural best practices, leading to suboptimal decision-making and crop losses.

4. Financial Vulnerability: 52% of agricultural households are in debt, with the average farmer earning only ₹10,000 monthly and lacking proper financial planning tools.

5. Verification Challenges: Buyers struggle to verify product quality and authenticity, while farmers have limited access to certification systems.

## SOLUTION OVERVIEW

Ankrishi addresses these challenges through an integrated mobile platform with five core components:

1. Direct Marketplace: Connects farmers directly with buyers (consumers, vendors, and businesses), eliminating unnecessary intermediaries and increasing farmer profits while reducing consumer prices.

2. Information Hub: Provides localized weather forecasts, market price data, and agricultural best practices in local languages, enabling informed decision-making.

3. Financial Management System: Offers digital tools for expense tracking, income management, and financial health assessment, helping farmers achieve greater financial stability.

4. Verification Framework: Establishes a robust verification system for all stakeholders, with quality certification and transparent product journeys that build trust throughout the supply chain.

5. Community Network: Facilitates knowledge sharing, collective bargaining, and resource pooling among farmers to amplify their market power and resilience.

## MARKET OPPORTUNITY

India's agricultural sector employs approximately 58% of the population and contributes 17% to the country's GDP. The addressable market includes:

- 120+ million farming households across India
- 1.3+ billion consumers of agricultural products
- 12+ million agricultural vendors and retailers
- Growing demand for traceable, quality-verified agricultural products

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

Ankrishi will execute a phased, village-by-village scaling strategy:

1. Phase 1 (Year 1): Establish presence in 50 villages across Maharashtra, focusing on direct marketplace and information access features.

2. Phase 2 (Years 2-3): Expand to 500 villages across 3 states, introducing financial management tools and verification systems.

3. Phase 3 (Years 4-5): Scale to 5,000 villages across 7-10 states, implementing the full community network and advanced features.

This approach ensures contextual relevance with solutions tailored to local agricultural conditions, high adoption rates through community-based onboarding with local champions, and sustainable growth through multiple revenue streams.

## BUSINESS MODEL

Ankrishi will generate revenue through multiple streams:

1. Marketplace Commission: 2% transaction fee on non-produce category products
2. Premium Features: Subscription-based access to advanced analytics and tools
3. Delivery Services: Fee-based logistics support for product transportation
4. Value-Added Services: Commission on financial products, insurance, and certifications

This diversified model ensures sustainability while keeping core services accessible to all farmers.

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

Ankrishi differentiates itself from other agritech solutions through:

1. Comprehensive Integration: Addressing interconnected challenges through a single platform rather than isolated point solutions

2. Contextual Design: Solutions tailored to Indian agricultural realities, including varying levels of connectivity and digital literacy

3. Trust-Based Ecosystem: Verification systems that create confidence throughout the supply chain

4. Scalable Architecture: Firebase backend that supports growth from 10,000 to 1 million+ users with planned migration to more robust systems at scale

## LONG-TERM VISION

Ankrishi aims to become India's most trusted agricultural ecosystem, creating a future where:

- Farmers receive fair value for their produce and achieve financial stability
- Rural communities thrive through improved agricultural economics
- Agricultural knowledge flows freely across geographical and social boundaries
- Technology bridges rather than widens the urban-rural divide

By rebuilding the foundation of Indian agriculture one village at a time, Ankrishi will contribute to a more equitable, efficient, and sustainable agricultural sector that benefits all stakeholders in the value chain.
