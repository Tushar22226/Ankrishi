# Problem Statement: Ankrishi

## Background
Agriculture in India faces significant challenges with fragmented supply chains, limited market access for farmers, and inefficient distribution systems. Small and marginal farmers often struggle to get fair prices for their produce due to multiple intermediaries, lack of market information, and limited negotiation power.

## Problem Definition
1. **Market Access**: Farmers have limited direct access to buyers, forcing them to rely on intermediaries who often take a significant portion of the profits.
2. **Price Transparency**: Lack of real-time market information leads to unfair pricing and exploitation.
3. **Quality Verification**: Buyers have difficulty verifying the quality and origin of agricultural products.
4. **Financial Inclusion**: Limited access to financial services, including payments, credit, and insurance for agricultural stakeholders.
5. **Supply Chain Inefficiency**: Fragmented supply chains lead to wastage, delays, and increased costs.

## Target Audience
- Small and marginal farmers
- Agricultural vendors and buyers
- Delivery partners
- Agricultural consultants

## Proposed Solution
Ankrishi is a comprehensive mobile platform that connects farmers directly with buyers, providing:

1. **Direct Marketplace**: Enabling farmers to list products and buyers to purchase directly, eliminating unnecessary intermediaries.
2. **Prelisting & Requirements**: Allowing advance orders and requirement posting to better match supply and demand.
3. **Verification System**: Building trust through a robust verification process for all stakeholders.
4. **Integrated Payments**: Secure wallet system for seamless transactions between parties.
5. **Order Management**: Efficient tracking and delivery system with clear timelines.
6. **Financial Tools**: Access to financial health assessment and relevant government schemes.
7. **Localized Approach**: Village-by-village scaling strategy with features tailored to local needs.

The platform aims to create a more equitable, efficient, and transparent agricultural marketplace that benefits all stakeholders while focusing on the needs of small farmers.
